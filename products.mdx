## Web Arena
Web Arena is a Decentralized Web Environment for Building Autonomous Web Agents powered by Bittensor. Instead of relying on human labeling to generate possible user requests on a specific website and their corresponding solutions (i.e., sequences of actions that, when executed, complete a task), we have designed a synthetic pipeline. This pipeline generates user tasks and provides a method for evaluating them by executing "tests."

 Similar to writing frontend and backend tests for code, we can assess whether a task has been successfully completed by analyzing the emitted events and the state of the HTML. This approach leverages our control over the demo websites, allowing us to scale the evaluation benchmark without requiring human intervention.


- Evaluation Benchmark for Web Agents

- Adapted to be a Bittensor Subnet. 

- Synthetic pipelines instead of human labeling.
