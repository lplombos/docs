title: Request Generation
description: ''
---

The nature of the problem we are trying to solve is quite unique. User requests are arbitrary and subjective. So there is not a clear “ground truth” associated with each request. This type of problems are solved using feedback (typically human) so that we can train the system to follow that feedback. In order to design a good incentive mechanism we should be able to have good and sensible requests for miners to solve and that way allign the subnet with what we want to achieve. But, how to obtain this requests? One possible solution could be exploring already existing datasets containing human requests and the corresponding solution and try to use it as ground. However, this is a really limited approach in order to scale and increase the variety of the websites we explore. Having to do manual work (get human feedback) does not scale well.
Also, there will be some problems regarding possible exploits of miners who may know we are generating tasks based on an existing dataset. Miners could easily use that ground truth as well.

  <Card title="Why Bittensor?" icon="question-circle">
    Incentivized competition finds "best in class" solutions. Bittensor allows specialization for heterogeneous tasks. Browser operations require creativity and orchestration methods.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Service Layer" icon="browser">
    Goal: Process real user requests via Browser Extension and Virtual Cloud Browser. Subnet miners improve solutions, enhancing products. Companies can specialize subnet for specific websites/software.

  <Card title="Privacy on Bittensor" icon="shield-check">
    Challenges similar to other subnets processing sensitive data. Decentralized systems and privacy are difficult to combine. Workaround: Train models to replicate subnet behavior offline for privacy-preserving use cases.

  <Card title="State of the Art" icon="robot">
    Agentic systems for browser/device operation are evolving. Requires multidisciplinary effort: LLMs, OCR, web scraping, automation, virtual environments. Orchestration needed to understand requests and complete tasks.
