title: Browser Assistance Subnet
description: 'Operate Browser on behalf of users'
---


With the intention to fully dive into Bittensor ecosystem and to increase Autoppia´s capabilities we aim to deploy our own subnet. This subnet will be dedicated to build a Browser Assistant that effectively solve user requests by operating the browser on behalf of the user. 

Although this subnet is fully independent, by combining it with products like Autoppia AI workers and Coworker (Browser Extension) we will manage to create an amazing end product for users.” This high quality product will lead to monetization, which will bring higher subnet emissions as well as more competition to the subnet and therefore make a product with higher quality.

  <Accordion title="Why Bittensor?">
    An Incentived competition is really powerfull when needing to find the "best in class" solution for a given task. Also, Bittensor allow high levels of specialization when dealing with heterogenous tasks that requeire different approaches and subtleties. Browser Opeation have all this characteristics and will require creativity and orquestration methods to solve them successfully.

  <Accordion title="Service layer">
    The end goal is to use this subnet to process real and organic user requests. To do that, Autoppia has already started developing a Browser Extension and a Virtual Cloud Browser environment to allow user make their requests and to also execute the workflows. The better the subnet miners become on generarting solutions to users request the better this products will be. 
    
    Companies will be able to decide which websites and softwares the subnet specializes on making the subnet bandwidth valuable.

  <Accordion title="Privacy on Bittensor">
    This subnet suffer similar challenges and problems to other subnets where organic traffic may contain private and sensitive information. For example, subnet 18 process LLM prompts made by users. In this subnet we deal with user requests and with user browser contexts so privacy become key. 

    The conclusion to this privacy dilema on bittensor is that there is no easy way to have decentralized systems and privacy simultaneously. Therefore, users must know this when using subnet directly. However, there is an easy work around to this problem and is to train models in order to replicate the subnet behaviour "offline". We can consider the subnet as a really powerfull data generator about how to operate a browser given a specific request. Training an opersource (LLama3 for example) and running it offline is a really valid and reasonably good solution to run privacy preserving use cases. 

    This "offline" approach can be even a good ideas in order to meet extremely

  <Accordion title="State of the art">
    Agentic systems that can succesfully operate browser/devices through standard interfaces are a worthy goal to pursue. There are some open source and propieraty initiatives that aim to successfully operate mobile devices, computers, browsers, applications, etc. However, this is a relatively new area in constant progress. 

    Achieving such a system requires the use of many different tools and technologies like LLMs, OCRs for getting visual information of the web page, Web scraping, HTML cleaning and data extraction, Web Automation (to actually execute the actions), Virtual environments, browser drivers, Chromnium (to deploy browsers).

    Its a multidisciplinary effort to orquestrate all this tools to successfully understand a user request, decide how to solve it and actually complete the task.
