title: Request Generation

---

The nature of the problem we are trying to solve is quite unique. User requests are arbitrary and subjective. So there is not a clear “ground truth” associated with each request. This type of problems are solved using feedback (typically human) so that we can train the system to follow that feedback. In order to design a good incentive mechanism we should be able to have good and sensible requests for miners to solve and that way allign the subnet with what we want to achieve. But, how to obtain this requests? One possible solution could be exploring already existing datasets containing human requests and the corresponding solution and try to use it as ground. However, this is a really limited approach in order to scale and increase the variety of the websites we explore. Having to do manual work (get human feedback) does not scale well.
Also, there will be some problems regarding possible exploits of miners who may know we are generating tasks based on an existing dataset. Miners could easily use that ground truth as well.


## Organic requests vs synthetic requests
This pipeline is intended to work without the need of organic traffic. However, using Autoppia Browser Extension and a layer for securing and eliminating sensible data, it would be awesome to include on this pipeline real user prompts (instead of synthetic ones generated by validators) and a real browser (the user´s one) where actions will be executed. Eventually, user can give feedback to achieve RLHF and improve the overall pipeline. This will also allow us to have more diverse and complex browser states and prompts. 

<Note>Including organic requests, human feedback and real browser execution into the pipeline is on the roadmap!</Note>

## Synthetic Prompts
In the absence of organic promts there is the possibility to create synthetic prompts using enough browser context. This prompts will then enter the pipeline as standard organic ones 

## Organic User Requests (Future release)
This correspond to real requests from users. This requests will be introduced on the autoppia browser extension chat and will be sent to Autoppia Validator. The Validator will then perform the standard pipeline. Eventually, the validator will send the workflow to the user to be executed there. 

In order for this to work, the users browser state has to be in one way or another accessed by miners and validators. Privacy is a fundamental problem in both Bittensor as a whole and in our subnet. This problem has arised now but will continue to arise as privacy is a frequent requirement in real world applications. And if bittensor wants to really compete with propietary solutions out there, we must find a solution. 

The approach to solve this issue is applying measures like using An independent browser session and using an AI filtering layer to find sensible data on the user context and removing it or change it to placeholders. Although this can make some use cases impossible (like directly asking for a password value shown on screen for example) most of use cases can be abstracted from the specific values of certain variables.
