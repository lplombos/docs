title: Browser Operation Subnet
description: 'Operate Browser on behalf of users'
sidebarTitle: "Overview"
---

With the intention to fully dive into Bittensor ecosystem and to increase Autoppia´s capabilities we aim to deploy our own subnet. This subnet will be dedicated to build a Browser Assistant that effectively solve user requests by operating the browser on behalf of the user. 

Although this subnet is fully independent, by combining it with products like Autoppia AI workers and Coworker (Browser Extension) we will manage to create an amazing end product for users.” This high quality product will lead to monetization, which will bring higher subnet emissions as well as more competition to the subnet and therefore make a product with higher quality.

  <Card title="Why Bittensor?" icon="question-circle">
    Incentivized competition finds "best in class" solutions. Bittensor allows specialization for heterogeneous tasks. Browser operations require creativity and orchestration methods.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Service Layer" icon="browser">
    Goal: Process real user requests via Browser Extension and Virtual Cloud Browser. Subnet miners improve solutions, enhancing products. Companies can specialize subnet for specific websites/software.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Privacy on Bittensor" icon="shield-check">
    Challenges similar to other subnets processing sensitive data. Decentralized systems and privacy are difficult to combine. Workaround: Train models to replicate subnet behavior offline for privacy-preserving use cases.
  </Card>
  <Card title="State of the Art" icon="robot">
    Agentic systems for browser/device operation are evolving. Requires multidisciplinary effort: LLMs, OCR, web scraping, automation, virtual environments. Orchestration needed to understand requests and complete tasks.
