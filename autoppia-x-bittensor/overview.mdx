## Why Bittensor?
Bittensor's decentralized infrastructure provides a great opportunity to improve and increase Autoppia's AI capabilities. By participating in the Bittensor ecosystem, Autoppia will incorporate subnet services and products, enhancing our platform's functionality and reach. By leveraging bittensor's highly competitive solutions, Autoppia will enhance its capabilities and tools, offering more useful products.

## Bittensor x AI Workers

> Autoppia x Bittensor will allow users to create their own applications (AI workers) while using subnets as commodities, services or tools. This will bring agentic systems into the bittensor community. 


Here are some examples of services that are currently under development on bittensor that could be added to Autoppia:
