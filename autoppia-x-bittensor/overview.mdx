## Bittensor x AI Workers

> Autoppia x Bittensor will allow users to create their own applications (AI workers) while using subnets as commodities, services or tools. This will bring agentic systems into the bittensor community. 


Here are some examples of services that are currently under development on bittensor that could be added to Autoppia:
