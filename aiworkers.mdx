Autoppia is an innovative platform that allows you to deploy AI Workers—intelligent agents that handle your daily tasks, automate processes, and interact with your existing software tools. Our mission is to provide an out-of-the-box solution leveraging the capabilities of Generative AI, so you can focus on what truly matters.

## Vision

**Gen AI is a revolution**. It has proven outstanding capabilities and a high degree of reasoning. However, for AI to reach its full potential, it needs to interact directly with the world—not just process text and language. Autoppia bridges this gap by enabling AI systems to operate within your business environment.

AI is going to change dramatically how people work and interact with software. Legacy software will have to evolve and include more **"language oriented"** interfaces becoming interchangeable tools where UI and UX will  have a lot less importance where knowing the details and intricacies of a software will not be needed anymore as it will be operated in a "high level" manner. 

<Tip>Overall, people will be allowed to focus on what really matters delegating tasks completely to AI.</Tip>

## Mission

The same way that Dashboards, CRMs, ERPs and other automation solutions were easy to use abstractions and interfaces on more complex business processes and data sources, we need to create a **higher layer** in order to manage all the new AI processes that will be needed to operate a business. 

This solution will become the *default interface* for interacting with business processes and data. All legacy software with enough standardized interfaces (like an API) will serve as tools under the management of AI. 

Our mission is to provide an '**out of the box**' solution to leverage and manage all these new capabilities that Gen AI can provide while allowing sufficient abstraction and customization to enable users to complete their specific tasks. 

We aim to develop a variety of solutions and applications to widely integrate Generative AI into numerous people's lives and organizations. Our entire ecosystem is centered around the concept of "**AI Workers**".
