<br/>
General Purpose Language Models has become an incredible powerfull tool in order to **solve and automate arbitrary user tasks**. However, they are not enough by their own. In order to build fully working AI sytems that can perform actions in the real world some kind of orquestration has to be done. We called this orquestration of technologies and tools: **AI Workers**. 

<br/>

## What do AI workers consist of?
<br/>

<Card title="Language Models" icon="database">
  AI workers are powered by LLMs. This is where they obtain reasoning capabilities and knowledge. Our design is abstract and agnostic meaning that we are not coupled with any solutions or LLM providers. For instance, as long as the model support function tooling, AI workers can be powered by different LLMs like GPT4 or Mixtral.

<Card title="Integrations" icon="webhook">
  This are third party services and applications. Integrations allow connectivity between AI workers and external services therefore extending the workers capabilities. Integrations refer just to the connectivity and the configuration of this services. This configuration may include sensible data like credentials which will not in any case be included in the context window of LLMs. 
</Card>

<Card title="Knowledge" icon="graduation-cap">
  All the documentation that the worker has access to (PDFs, TXTs, Excels etc). Queried by RAG systems or accessed individually. This include traditional documents and vector stores. Usually accessed via retrieval systems.  
</Card>

<Card title="Tools" icon="screwdriver-wrench">
  Tools enable real world interaction and narrow arbitrary tasks into more manageable and contextualizable actions with predictable inputs and outputs. This tools lead to a more deterministic and traditional way of solving things allowing legacy tech to be easily used. This tools will usually require Integrations as the providers of connectivity and configuration. 
</Card>

<Card title="Memory" icon="memory">
  Access to past interactions. This will allow for the improvement over time. This is usually implemented by finetunning the LLMs that power the worker but can be also implemented with RAG systems. This will be key for increasing the performace and reliability by introducing RLHF (Human feedback). 
</Card>

<Card title="Interfaces" icon="sidebar">
  Although tools are really powerfull they require specific technical development and connectivity that not always is possible. There will be times when to complete a task AI workers will need to use interfaces like computers, mobile devices, browsers, softwares etc to access functionality that otherwise will not be accesible. This approach is significantly more complex as we will be using human interfaces that have been developed specially for AI. 
</Card>

<Card title="Communications Chanels" icon="headset">
  AI workers will be able to receive instructions and user's feedback through different channels. Usually in the form of a chat conversation. AI workers can be contacted via standard messaging apps like Whatsapp or Telegram or through a dedicated chat interface inyected on the user browser [Autoppia Browser Extension](). Each channel have different use cases and limitations.

## Use Case:
>**Objective**: User wants to register a client in a traditional CRM. 


### How could it be done?

+ **Low Level**: By interacting directly with the CRM database where data is stored one can register a new client. Although difficult and complex its possible to reason which tables to update and with which data. 

+ **Existing Use Cases**: By leveraging legacy systems like already existing APIs. Most of user queries are associated with an use case (API Endpoint) or an orquestration of them. Note that with just an Open API documentation and authenticated user credentials this approach is possible. No need to actually program each use case which leads to a really easy intergration. 

+ **Interfaces**: Finally client registration can be done through the _CRM web interface_. This is the most difficult approac but the one with less requirements as there is no connectivity or access to API needed. This would be done by operating the browser on behalf of the user. 

<Tip>With this example we realize that there are multiple ways of achieving the same outcome. But not all are equally difficult. Whenever possible, using already defined use cases such as API endpoints or specifically designed tools  is the way to go as its a nice balance between abstraction and parametrization. </Tip>
