## AI Workers through API

Instead of developing your own AI stack or using low level frameworks like Langchain, Autoppia provides an out of the box solution to configure a basic but powerfull AI layer. You can leverage AI workers thoughg API to build your own application and use cases. 

This is not an alternative to other LLM providers. Autoppia just provides an orquestration and configuration layer so users can easily add functionality. 

<Note> Autoppia API Comming Soon! </Note>
